# Project 07: Hybrid Control + RL (Residual Policy)

## Timeline
3-4 weeks

## Goal
Compare pure-control, pure-RL, and residual hybrid approaches for stability and smoothness.

## Build Checklist
- [ ] Build baseline PD or tracking controller
- [ ] Train residual RL policy that outputs corrections
- [ ] Compare pure RL, pure control, and hybrid approaches
- [ ] Evaluate stability and smoothness

## Deliverable Checklist
- [ ] Comparative experiment results
- [ ] Technical explanation of why hybrid systems are used in real robots

## Starter Structure
- `src/`
- `tests/`
- `docs/`
- `artifacts/`
