# Project 04: PPO From Scratch

## Timeline
4-6 weeks

## Goal
Implement a minimal but reliable PPO stack with reproducible experiments and stability diagnostics.

## Build Checklist
- [ ] Build minimal RL framework: logging, seeding, checkpointing
- [ ] Implement PPO: clipped objective, GAE, entropy bonus, advantage normalization
- [ ] Run multi-seed experiments
- [ ] Diagnose and fix instability cases

## Run On
- [ ] CartPole
- [ ] One continuous-control toy environment

## Deliverable Checklist
- [ ] Reproducible experiments
- [ ] Learning curves and performance comparisons

## Starter Structure
- `src/`
- `tests/`
- `docs/`
- `artifacts/`
