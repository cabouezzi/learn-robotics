# Project 03: Control Fundamentals Lab (Inverted Pendulum)

## Timeline
3-4 weeks

## Goal
Build a control fundamentals lab to compare classical control behavior on unstable dynamics.

## Build Checklist
- [ ] Implement nonlinear pendulum dynamics simulation
- [ ] Implement PID controller
- [ ] Implement LQR controller
- [ ] Compare stability, convergence, and robustness
- [ ] Demonstrate unstable behavior and tuning fixes

## Deliverable Checklist
- [ ] Clear plots for state, control input, and stability comparison
- [ ] Short technical writeup explaining results

## Starter Structure
- `src/`
- `tests/`
- `docs/`
- `artifacts/`
