# Project 06: Domain Randomization & Robustness Study

## Timeline
3-4 weeks

## Goal
Quantify the robustness gains from domain randomization under shifted physics.

## Build Checklist
- [ ] Train baseline policy without randomization
- [ ] Train randomized policy with mass/inertia variation, sensor noise, and action delay
- [ ] Evaluate robustness under changed physics

## Deliverable Checklist
- [ ] Side-by-side performance comparison
- [ ] Robustness analysis plots
- [ ] Technical explanation of why randomization helps
