# Learn Robotics

This repository now uses a lean, hire-ready, manipulation-focused roadmap scaffold.

## Active Roadmap (8 Projects)

1. [Project 01: Rigid-Body Geometry Toolkit (Transforms)](project-01-rigid-body-geometry-toolkit-transforms/README.md)
2. [Project 02: 6-DOF Arm Kinematics Engine](project-02-6dof-arm-kinematics-engine/README.md)
3. [Project 03: Control Fundamentals Lab (Inverted Pendulum)](project-03-control-fundamentals-lab-inverted-pendulum/README.md)
4. [Project 04: PPO From Scratch](project-04-ppo-from-scratch/README.md)
5. [Project 05: Manipulation in Simulation (Reach, Push, Pick)](project-05-manipulation-in-simulation-reach-push-pick/README.md)
6. [Project 06: Domain Randomization & Robustness Study](project-06-domain-randomization-and-robustness-study/README.md)
7. [Project 07: Hybrid Control + RL (Residual Policy)](project-07-hybrid-control-plus-rl-residual-policy/README.md)
8. [Project 08: Performance Engineering for RL](project-08-performance-engineering-for-rl/README.md)

## Project Folder Standard

Each active project includes:

- `src/` for implementation code
- `tests/` for unit and integration tests
- `docs/` for technical notes and experiment writeups
- `artifacts/` for outputs (plots, metrics, checkpoints metadata)

## Legacy Roadmap

The previous scaffold has been preserved in `legacy-roadmap-v1/`.
