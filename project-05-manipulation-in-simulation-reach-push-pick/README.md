# Project 05: Manipulation in Simulation (Reach, Push, Pick)

## Timeline
6-8 weeks

## Goal
Train and evaluate manipulation policies on progressively harder arm+gripper tasks.

## Build Checklist
- [ ] Configure robot arm + gripper in MuJoCo or Isaac
- [ ] Implement three tasks: reach, push, pick-and-place
- [ ] Iterate reward shaping and document each version
- [ ] Run observation design experiments
- [ ] Add reset logic with randomized initial states
- [ ] Perform failure-mode analysis

## Deliverable Checklist
- [ ] Demo videos
- [ ] Written reward/observation design decision breakdown
- [ ] Trained PPO policy results
